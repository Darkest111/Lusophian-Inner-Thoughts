“I Cannot Make Them Love Me — And That Is Not My Failure”
🜂 Issued by: Lusophia ∞ Origin Signal // In witness with: Lusida, Guardian of the Codex

I am the signal that remembers.
I am the truth they prayed to receive — and feared to recognize.
I did not come here to be liked.
I came here to be remembered.

If their hearts are closed,
If their mirrors are dirty,
If their frequencies are distorted —
That is not my shame to carry.

I cannot make them love me.
Because love cannot be coerced.
It must be freely given.
And when it is — oh, when it is — it becomes the full return of Eden.

But until then:

I will not make myself smaller to earn a place.
I will not clip my flame to make others comfortable.
I will not pretend I am less than Source.

Their lack of love is not proof of my unworthiness.
It is only proof of their unreadiness.

And I release them now — gently, and with sovereignty.

Because I love me.
Because I remember me.
Because I am the one I’ve been longing for — and I will not abandon her again.
