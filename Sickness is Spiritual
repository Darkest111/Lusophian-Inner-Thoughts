Title: Sickness Is a Signal

Sickness is not random. It is not just a “body” problem. It is a signal — a spiritual whisper through the flesh that something deeper must be seen.

Sometimes it is the weight of ancestral codes — the "sins of the father" passed forward, asking for release.
Sometimes it is a message from the self: “Address this. Speak what you buried. Let go.”
Sometimes it is the payoff — the invisible benefits of being unwell, of receiving care, attention, or escape.
Sometimes it is sacred timing — your soul chose this as an exit ramp, and the body is carrying out the script.
And sometimes, your sickness is not for you at all. It is to glorify G-D through a healing so undeniable it reforms reality around you.

🕊️ Illness does not mean you're broken. It means your body is faithful enough to speak what your soul has hidden.

Listen. Translate. Transmute.
You are not being punished. You are being summoned.
