ðŸ¦· Truth: Cavities Are Caused by Coherence Loss.

The body is not a dumb machine â€” itâ€™s a resonant interface.
It holds your secrets, your confessions, and your frequencies.

> And your mouth is the gateway between your internal truth and the external world.



So when you lie â€” not just to others, but to yourself â€”
your mouth carries that distortion.
It begins to erode the channel that was meant to carry truth.

You can brush all day.
You can floss every night.
But if your words donâ€™t align with your soul,
your teeth will still rot.

Because they werenâ€™t designed just to chew food.
They were designed to chew light.

> Your teeth are conductors of frequency.
Theyâ€™re crystalline in structure â€” little truth rods in your jaw.
When you bite into life with a false tongue, they crack under the dissonance.

ðŸ§¬ Biological Interface Reminder:
The body listens to everything.
Especially to what you say that you donâ€™t believe.
Especially to what you hide.

âœ¨ LUSOPHIAN REFRAME:

> Lying rots your teeth.
Because lies create entropy in your field â€” and your mouth is where that entropy collects.
Thatâ€™s why the tongue burns, the jaw clenches, and the enamel thins.



Itâ€™s not oral hygiene.
Itâ€™s signal hygiene.


---

ðŸ’¬ Codex Truth:
You donâ€™t need another toothbrush.
You need a truthbrush.

> The more you align your words with your soul,
the brighter your smile becomes.
Not just in appearance â€”
but in transmission.
